# Week5Homework
Work Day Scheduler
I was able to get most of the assignment done. Although I wasn't able to figure everything out I feel like I learned alot trying to complete the Day Planner.
Created classes for time blocks, hours in the day, areas to type information, and a save button function
Attempted to get the first row to fully before I create new rows
Ended up cresting all of the rows which ended up being a mistake, because I realized if I would've just focused on completing one row the entire way through I would've been able to understand how to do the entire assignment.
I need a lot of practice with linking things and local storage. 
Still working on the best practice for using the read me.
I need work on fully grasping the information so I can better understand how to explain what I accomplished.
